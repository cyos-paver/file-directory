        You two are the most widely discussed individuals in your field, in large part due to your groundbreaking work and unique mother-daughter relationship. 
        So, what inspired you to pursue pharmaceutical research together?<br>
        </b><br>
        
        W: I really have to thank my mother for where I am today. 
        She has always been an inspiration to me with her incredible work ethic, 
        and I’m honored to have the opportunity to work with her in our shared interests. 
        Moreover, from a young age she instilled in me a desire to help as many people as possible. 
        And although helping people directly was difficult for me with my troubles navigating most social situations, 
        she guided me towards a path where I would be able to do what I wanted without having to interact with many others.<br>
        <br>
        P: If I had to add on, I believe that our ability to communicate effectively with one another made the decision to work together simple. 
        Communication and collaboration are key in a research setting, 
        which is why it is crucial to have receptive colleagues in our lab so we can maintain optimal efficiency.<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        You’ve recently won several awards for your research on new antipsychotic medication. 
        Where do you think you will be focusing your attention next?<br>
        </b><br>
        
        P: We developed Phoboxin to try and provide a safe alternative to pre-established typical antipsychotics with children and adolescents in mind. 
        To that end, we succeeded. However, there is still much suffering in the city. We cannot sit idly by as many live horrible, 
        degenerate lives with no source of aid; all of this anguish must be corrected, 
        and we will do whatever it takes to see it extinguished. As such, 
        we intend to launch a foundation in the coming months that has one aim: 
        to produce drugs that will release people from their ailments and their pain.<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        Many have noticed that you are not sponsored by any public or private institutions, 
        like CY-Tech or CYOS Community College, and I think we’re all curious as to how you’ve managed to stay afloat without the financial support. 
        Care to share your secret?<br>
        </b><br>
        
        W: Being financed by outside sponsors is, in essence, making an agreement with them. 
        And it’s stifling, having to defer to someone else. We never wanted to restrict our work to fit the whims of someone else, 
        and we’ve been lucky to so far have the freedom to do what we want. To answer your question, though, there is no “secret”; 
        it’s been sheer luck and a lot of difficult decisions that have pulled us through.<br>
        <br>
        It’s not as ideal as it seems to be either. In the lab, we’re using old and outdated equipment because we have no alternatives. 
        Of course everything is safe—we would never compromise the safety of our associates—but there’s been many instances where we have 
        to ask ourselves, “Can we go another month without this?” or 
        “Would this work in place of that?” and the answer is more often than not yes out of necessity. 
        Still, I think everyone would agree that penny-pinching is better than having to deal with someone breathing down your neck.<br>
        <br>
        <b>
        It’s obvious that many people will be reading this, some potentially interested in following a similar path to the one that you took. 
        Is there anything you would like to say to them, before we end this?<br>
        </b><br>
        
        W: To everyone out there, I want you to know that it’s hard doing what we do. 
        You will doubt yourself, you can’t help it. 
        I usually struggle the most right before I sleep or when I wake up, 
        and what I tell myself to push through is that I’m making a difference, even if I don’t realize it. So don’t give up.<br>
        <br>
        P: The end crowns the work.
